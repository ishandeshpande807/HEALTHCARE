## Project Description
This project involves analyzing heart failure data to compare various health metrics (anemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium) with death events (0,1) using Excel, SQL, Tableau. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that could inform medical decisions and patient care.


## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the heart failure dataset using Excel.
- Perform data analysis using SQL queries.
- Create interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau .
- Provide data-driven insights and recommendations for heart failure management.


## Dataset
The dataset contains information about patients with heart failure, including various health metrics and the death event indicator in binary form.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
